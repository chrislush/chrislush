## <p align="center">Hello there! Christine typing 👩‍💻</p>
Self-taught full-stack developer with a background in mathematics and budding penchant for front-end game development. My transition from education to software engineering stems from a desire to marry my proclivity for puzzles and problem solving with a deep-seated love for devising engaging, accessible user experiences. As a teacher, I relished the opportunity to create compelling materials to help my students take ownership of their learning, and now I channel that same energy into building intuitive user-centred software. My enjoyment of gamifying features and focussing on accessibility has led me to specialise front-end development, where I can continue fostering creativity and inclusion in the digital world.
